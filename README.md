# koji-rekor-plugin
Koji Hub plugin that initiates automatic uploads to Rekor Transparency Server whenever an RPM is signed in Koji to enable additional supply chain security

# Purpose
A Rekor transparency log records immutable records of artifacts and their signature materials that can be queried for inclusion proof and signature metadata. Rekor creates an immutable chain of custody by being a timestamped source of truth that individuals can check their software against. It's an accessible tool that simplifies the process of signature verification. This plugin  enables parties to incorporate Rekor into their Koji workflows; in doing so, they and others can independently verify RPM packages to increase trust, traceability, and non-repudiation.

# Usage
Koji doesnâ€™t natively sign RPMs. The proper mechanism to sign a package is to:
  1. Make a copy of the unsigned RPM
  2. Sign the RPM with `rpmsign -addsign <rpm_package>` or a signing system/server
  3. Import the signed RPM headers to Koji Hub using `koji import-sig`

The Rekor plugin triggers upon the Koji callback 'PostRPMSign', which occurs whenever an RPM signature header is imported to Koji. The plugin takes the signed RPM, it's signature, and the relevant public key that is stored on the signing machine and uploads the materials to a Rekor transparency log. If the upload is successful, the log returns an inclusion proof that is saved in the directory `rekor-logs` under Koji's top directory.
